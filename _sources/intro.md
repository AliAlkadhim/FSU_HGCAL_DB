HGCAL DB is DB .....


These tutorials grew from me working on the DB as a grad student and member of the CMS experiment, and wanting to gather all these things in one place. I think such a resource is important if we were 
to make this DB (and CMS databases in general) better, and involve more people and ideas into their development, and to have this information readily available, but separate from the official documentation of each of the covered tools.
