### To-do: make automation functionality to slite DB as well, so that they can quickly access/see results with sqlitebrowser

This repo is uses mysql (as well as sqlite3) to build an SQL relational database for the HGCAL data at FSU from existing spreadsheets (converted to csv tables). The power really comes when it is combined with the HGCAL automatic analysis code (at https://gitlab.cern.ch/CLICdp/HGCAL/lcd_hgcal_analysisworkflows). Thus this package, when the analysis code is also installed, allows for completely automatic updating of the database. To interact with the database (queries, etc.), you can use sqlitebrowser for the files ending with .db. For the complete SQL database (requiring server, user and password), ending in .sql, our choice is to use mysql, interfaced with mysql Workbench.
