# Making IV/CV XML Tables for CMS HGCAL DB

We support the conversion of raw CMS HGCAL sensor test data to the XML schema formats accepted by the central CMS HGCAL database. We support the conversion of the following 4 sensor tables:

**`[HGC_CERN_SENSOR_IV, HGC_CERN_SENSOR_CV, HGC_CERN_SENSOR_IV_SUMRY, HGC_CERN_SENSOR_CV_SUMRY]`**

Which are all in the `CMS_HGC_HGCAL_COND` account of the central XML schema.

To make tables to upload to the `int2r` CMS HGCAL DB, based on the XML table tempates in `CMS_HGCAL_DB/from_Umesh/CMS_HGCAL_DB/from_Umesh/XML Templates HGCAL Si Sensors.docx`, do

**`python TXT_TO_XML.py --f <.TXT DATA FILE NAME> --t <TABLE NAME>`**

For example, to produce an xml file for the `HGC_CERN_SENSOR_IV` table associated with the test results in `HPK_8in_198ch_2019_N4792_18_03242022_FullRetest_IV.txt` do

**`python TXT_TO_XML.py --f HPK_8in_198ch_2019_N4792_18_03242022_FullRetest_IV.txt --t HGC_CERN_SENSOR_IV`**

This produces `N4792_18_03242022_FullRetest_HGC_CERN_SENSOR_IV_TEST.xml` which can now be uploaded to the DB. Do `python TXT_TO_XML.py --help` for help.

To use other available optional arguments, do for example

`python TXT_TO_XML.py --f HPK_8in_198ch_2019_N4792_18_03242022_FullRetest_IV.txt --t HGC_CERN_SENSOR_IV --user Ali --location FSU --comment 'no comment'`


To produce an xml file for the `HGC_CERN_SENSOR_CV` table associated with the test results in `HPK_8in_198ch_2019_200118_20220707_test1_CV.txt` do

**`python TXT_TO_XML.py --f HPK_8in_198ch_2019_200118_20220707_test1_CV.txt --t HGC_CERN_SENSOR_CV`**

This produces `200118_20220707_test1_HGC_CERN_SENSOR_CV_TEST.xml` which is ready to be uploaded to the the DB.
