    "sqlite is a full-featured relational database system. Sqlite does not use a client-server architecture: all the code for the database is contained in the driver . All the data for each database is contained in a simple *platform-independent* file. It is powerful,  secure, and especially efficient since it doesn't use a server. It is included in most python distributions, so it was preinstalled on 619. \n",
    "If your python distribution for some reason doesn't include sqlite3, install it with the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt-get install sqlite3`\n",

    "! It is both an executable and a python module, so tunning `sqlite3` in the terminal will open up the sqlite3 shell, such that you can run any of the commands in the shell directly. Alternatively, you can use it as a python module as I shall describe below. \n",

    "Even more convenient, sqlite databases (that is, databses ending in `.db`) allow one to use sqlitebrowser to do quick inspection, queries and other commands using a Graphical User Interface (GUI), without much knowledge of any syntax. If you don't have sqlitebrowser, **I highly recommend that you install it** and use it. If you have Debian architectures, it can be installed with\n",
